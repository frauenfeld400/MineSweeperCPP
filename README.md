# MineSweeperCPP
Minesweeper written in C++.

Originally a project to determine how quickly I could make an extremely simple minesweeper clone in C++,
this project evolved into me wanting to create a fully functioning text-based minesweeper clone, and 
trying to do things in a console environment that I have never done before.

Upon completion, it should play entirely like minesweeper does, with mouse input and sounds. 

Until then, I have to learn how to replace text on a console screen instead of printing a new board
each time a change is made, how to prevent the user from resizing the board, how to play sounds,
how to remove the scroll bar, and come up with my own algorithm for revealing the tiles that are
meant to be revealed.
